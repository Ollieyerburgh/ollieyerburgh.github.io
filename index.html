                <h6> Situation </h6>                  
                  In a team of four, we had to first analyse the business context of a product and then create a landing page for the product based off our analysis, with features such as admin and user management and metrics
                <br></br>
                <h6> Technologies used </h6>
                  Ruby on Rails framework, following Rubocop coding standard. HAML, SASS, Ruby and Coffee script linked to a PostgreSQL database. Capybara was used as our testing suit. We used git for version management and Capistrano for deployment.
                <br> </br>
                <h6> My contribution </h6>
                  Although we were in a team of four, most of the programming was completed by myself, with 167/255 commits. I also wrote all 80 end to end tests for this project. Some key aspects included an admin page, which showed a variety of information using chartKick gem with Ahoy to track information such as location of page visitors. Two parts of the landing page that we tracked were how many times a user clicked on a particular feature or FAQ to reveal more information. This was shown in the admin page, so that they could see which features people are most interested in and which features users are least interested in. If it was found that many users were clicking on a particular FAQ, then it might indicate that the admin should include that information in the main landing page.

                <h6>Situation</h6>
                This project involved meeting with a real client to listen to their requirements. Based off their requirements, we created some user stories. We then created some basic wireframes which we showed to our client. We then created more detailed designs using Moqups. The system was designed to allow teachers to upload educational resources to a central database. They could either upload resources, such as PowerPoint decks, or activities, such as an open day. These could be searched through a form with a variety of filters.

                <h6> Contribution </h6>
                I took a leading role in this project, as I wanted to enhance my skills using web development frameworks, which I hadn’t used until this point. I was responsible for aspects such as generating and developing the models and controller methods, as well as all of the admin functionality such as user management, resource management and sending emails automatically. I also wrote 150 end to end tests and 60 unit tests. I received a 1.18 multiplier for this project as I contributed much more than the others.

                <h6>Situation</h6>
                This project was completed as my dissertation project. I wanted to base it on cryptocurrency as I was quite into cryptocurrency at the time. I had issues where it was annoying to find how much my portfolio was worth and how much it had increased, so I thought I could make a portfolio manager for cryptocurrency which could be controlled by voice. I found that other portfolio managers for Alexa were pretty terrible, so I decided to make a better one. I added functionality such as getting the price and price change of over 1000 cryptocurrencies, and functionality to predict the price of Bitcoin based off yesterday’s features.
                <br></br>
                <h6> Technologies used </h6>
                The project was created using AWS offerings such as Lambda and DynamoDB. I used Node.js to develop the core skill, and Python to implement the machine learning. 
                <br></br>
                <h6> What I learnt </h6>
                I chose Node.js as I knew that it would be useful to have experience using this language in the future. I learnt how to use async/await to handle asynchronous data. I also learnt how to use APIs such as to find the price of cryptocurrencies and to get historical data for machine learning. I’d never used machine learning before this project, and using it showed me how powerful of a tool it can be. The project was a success, with the skill being published to the Alexa skill store as can be found <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ollie-Yerburgh-CryptoInfo/dp/B07PMW7LCM/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=cryptoinfo&qid=1558003341&s=gateway&sr=8-1" target="_blank">here</a>.

                The aim of this project was to create a booking system for a dental practise with two components; one for the dentist and one for the reception staff. The systems were linked so that the dentist could see their appointments for the day and receptionists could see how much to change patients.

                <h6> Contribution </h6>
                I mainly focussed on the back end of this project, creating the methods for different buttons which contained SQL statements. Due to my contribution, I received a 1.1 multiplier as I completed more work than other students.

                The aim of this project was to create a web application that let users place an order for a pizza using twitter. The site also had added functionality such as different menus and different branches based off a user’s postcode, and admin functionality such as user management

                I created a lot of the main functionality for the website including most of the admin dashboard, user management and menu management. I also wrote over 100 cucumber tests for this project.
